# WindowsSystems
Creation of a Vacation Booking system using c# and WPF languages, with a XML database.

Potential vacationers can type the number of adults and children, the dates of interest and add options they require (pool, television, type of accommodation...). 
The information is forwarded to an agent, who then chooses appropriate options for the customer based on hotels that are in the system.
